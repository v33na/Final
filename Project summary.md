## Project Topic

Spotify data exploration to predict the mood of Patrick's list of songs
## Data Sets
We started with Spofity streams of 2017 - Data set I https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking and

Features per song (Top 10) - Data Set II.

and later we moved to 

## Data cleaning

We used Pandas Jupyter notebook to clean our data.To analyse the clusters with moods had to create our own data set from the data file.

## Machine Learning

We used k-means clustering algorithm to find the distribution of data. PCA is used to reduce the dimension .t-SNE is used to plot the clusters.The clusters are well formed with clear boundaries.Cluster 1 is the biggest cluster. 

To identify the mood of each cluster we used Patrick's list of songs and named each cluster according to Patrick's feelings. Cluster 0 - Feeling young, Cluster 1- energetic, cluster 2 - Loneliness, Cluster 3 - regret.

For mood classification we used K-nn (K-nearest neighbor)algorithm and confusion matrix is used to visualize the prediction.
Using k-nn classification checked the accuracy of the result.



## Data visualization Using Tableu

In Tableu we created an interactive dashboard -
Most popular tracks by number of streams
Streams over time
And popularity of a track globally
